	I graduated with a B.E. degree in Robotics Engineering from Beijing University of Technology in 2023. My research focuses at intersection of machine learning and robotics, particularly the following area:
	<li> Robotic manipulation problems including grasping and more dexterous operations
	<li> Simulation-to-Real
	<li> Computer vision in robotics
	</p>
    My research aims at artificial general intelligece embodied in the physical world in the long run, while solving real-world problems as we climb the mountain.
		Prior to the current role, I worked as the Director of Robot Manipulation at <a href="https://www.figure.ai"> Figure AI</a>, a staff research scientist
		at <a href="https://www.x.company/"> Google X </a>, now known as <a href="https://x.company/projects/intrinsic/">Intrinsic</a>, 
		and a senior researcher at <a href="http://www.vicarious.com"> Vicarious</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University in 2015, advised by
		<a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/"> Dr. Lawrence Carin</a>.
		I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2011.
